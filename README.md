# Artem's first WEB project

## What will we do?

Get F1 data from REST API and present in a HTML page

## How will it be done?

1. HTML page is loaded by the user
  - External resources loaded
     - Javascript file (my own file, on my computer)
     - Bootstrap
         - https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/
2. Javascript fetches F1 data from REST API
  - https://ergast.com/api/f1/current/last/results.json
3. Update HTML with template containing:
  - F1 data
  - With Bootstrap classes

When everything works, we want to:

- Publish our changed to git (on Github)
